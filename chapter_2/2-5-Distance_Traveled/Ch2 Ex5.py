# This program will calculate
# how far a car travels.

# Set the speed.
speed = 70

# Set the times.
time1 = 6
time2 = 10
time3 = 15

# Calculate the distance.
dist1 = speed * time1
dist2 = speed * time2
dist3 = speed * time3

# Display the results.
print('The car is going down the interstate at', speed,'mph.')

print('In 10 hours the car would have traveled', dist2,'miles.')
print('In 15 hours the car would have traveled', dist3,'miles.')
